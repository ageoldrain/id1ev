    <h2>Welcome to the Study! Please read the following instructions carefully. </h2>
    <p>
        The experiment proceeds in rounds. There will be ten rounds in total. 
     </p>     
           <p>
        In each round, before you observe anything, two coins will be flipped - a fair one (with equal probabilities of landing heads or tails), and a biased one (with a 95 out of 100 chance of landing heads). You will <b>not</b> be informed of their outcomes automatically.
      </p>  
        <p>
            Thus, in each round, two coins will be flipped, and you will not know the results.
